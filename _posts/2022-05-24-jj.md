<!-- #### Ubuntu 22.04 -->

Ubuntu finally fixed their shit with their new release of Jammy Jellyfish 22.04. Don't get me wrong, Linux might be a great operating system but when it comes to UI, ....

But now since Ubuntu 22.04 a lot of those issues were fixed starting with the resolution scale on my 4k laptop monitor in combination with external monitors.

Other than that Gnome got more customizable with the addition of more themes and layout.

The only bad thing I can think about is continuous integration of SNAP packages. The problem with Snap is it just takes way too much space to install simple packages unlike a simple apt package. 

The main difference between Snap and Apt is that apt will install an individual package on the system, while Snap will download a whole archive, with all the prerequisites inside, and install it in a confined folder that is isolated from the system. 
And don't get me wrong, I understand what the thought process behind this is but this just means that on a computer with less storage, you cant be installing packages left and right anymore but hey, it's something we have to live with I guess as a Debian user.

Overall I'm pretty happy with it, one of these days I will have to have to install Proxmox on to do some further testing on how well it manages under pressure.
