#### Cyberark Privileged Access Management training done!

It finally came to an end. After 4 days of an extensive privileged management course it finally came hit it's finale.
Met a lot of cool people, learned a bunch of stuff but now it's time for a mini break before my brain explodes again.

Overal the training went pretty well there was a lot of stuff i already knew so that made it of course a bit simpler but it was nice
to learn the small details of the PAM components and how they truly work with each other.

Not sure if i'll do the exam cause i dont really need it but if i get a free voucher i for sure will.

The next of the road map is the Cyberark Privileged Access Install and Configure training!, i think i plan that one for the end of June but we'll see but for now, Cheers!
