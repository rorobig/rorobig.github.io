A lot of people I've encountered recently have asked me about NFT's, and honestly it's a pretty confusing concept so I thought let me try to explain it in a  simple way so here I go.

NFT == Non-Fungible token, still confused? all good.

Non-Fungile basically means that it's unique ( in value) and u cant trade for something else. Think like Pokemon cards, If you have a shinny Charizard card and u want to trade it for a Magikarp. One would think U've lost it. that's the same concept that NFT uses. This is completely opposite to for example Bitcoin where if you were to trade 1 Bitcoin with someone , the value would remain the same.

### For the nerds

Now lets get a little bit deeper, NFT are basically part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a crypto currency, just like Bitcoin, but what makes NFT so special is that it's blockchain can store extra information like music, digital drawing , basically any digital media which make it work different than Ethereum coins.

###  So where do I buy?
Well if u wanna get in the hype and also be the owner of an NFT which can be later valued to $6.6 million like this guy.
I personally use Opensea, it has a great collection and purchasing is pretty easy.
