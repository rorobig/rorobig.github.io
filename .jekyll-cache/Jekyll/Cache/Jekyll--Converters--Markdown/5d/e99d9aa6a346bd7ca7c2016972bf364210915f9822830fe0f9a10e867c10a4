<h4 id="cyberark-privileged-access-management-training-done">Cyberark Privileged Access Management training done!</h4>

<p>It finally came to an end. After 4 days of an extensive privileged management course it finally came hit itâ€™s finale.
Met a lot of cool people, learned a bunch of stuff but now itâ€™s time for a mini break before my brain explodes again.</p>

<p>Overal the training went pretty well there was a lot of stuff i already knew so that made it of course a bit simpler but it was nice
to learn the small details of the PAM components and how they truly work with each other.</p>

<p>Not sure if iâ€™ll do the exam cause i dont really need it but if i get a free voucher i for sure will.</p>

<p>The next of the road map is the Cyberark Privileged Access Install and Configure training!, i think i plan that one for the end of June but weâ€™ll see but for now, Cheers!</p>
