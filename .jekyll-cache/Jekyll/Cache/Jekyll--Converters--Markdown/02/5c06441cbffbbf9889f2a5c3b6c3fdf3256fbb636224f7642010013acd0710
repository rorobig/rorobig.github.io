<h4 id="the-windows-11-experience">The windows 11 experience.</h4>
<p>Iâ€™ve been using windows 11 for 3 weeks now and Iâ€™ve got to say, the windows experienced has been significantly improved.<br />
What i like the most about it is the smoothness. The experience feels very polished and something I really appreciate is the new notification sound. In Windows 10 i found them quite sharp. In windows 11 they have been dimmed down to be less intense on the ears.</p>

<h4 id="wsl">WSL</h4>
<p>The holy saviour himself, Windows Subsystem for Linux. Back in the days I used to have a dual boot setup so I can do my school work or develop on. However developing on windows and figuring out environment variables is just not it. Luckily windows introduced the WSL which acts like a Linux virtual machine that sits directly on the Linux kernel. This remove the need to use virtual machines.</p>

<p>In Windows 10 the installation of WSL was a bit of a hassle. In windows 11 that processed has been simplified. Now with just a simple:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wsl --install</code> <br />
in PowerShell and your done.</p>

<h4 id="final-verdict">Final verdict</h4>
<p>All by all Windows 11 has a very refreshing look to it, Windows apps can now be managed via a the cli windows package manager win-get, the wallpapers are refreshing and the quality of the operating system just feels solid. The updates are more controlled now, meaning less update pop ups. Canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m about to type these words, but I think windows has finally done it.</p>
