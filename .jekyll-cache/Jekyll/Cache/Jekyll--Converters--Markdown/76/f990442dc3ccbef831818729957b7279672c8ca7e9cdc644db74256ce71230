<!-- #### Ubuntu 22.04 -->

<p>Ubuntu finally fixed their shit with their new release of Jammy Jellyfish 22.04. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Linux might be a great operating system but when it comes to UI, â€¦.</p>

<p>But now since Ubuntu 22.04 a lot of those issues were fixed starting with the resolution scale on my 4k laptop monitor in combination with external monitors.</p>

<p>Other than that Gnome got more customizable with the addition of more themes and layout.</p>

<p>The only bad thing I can think about is continuous integration of SNAP packages. The problem with Snap is it just takes way too much space to install simple packages unlike a simple apt package.</p>

<p>The main difference between Snap and Apt is that apt will install an individual package on the system, while Snap will download a whole archive, with all the prerequisites inside, and install it in a confined folder that is isolated from the system. 
And donâ€™t get me wrong, I understand what the thought process behind this is but this just means that on a computer with less storage, you cant be installing packages left and right anymore but hey, itâ€™s something we have to live with I guess as a Debian user.</p>

<p>Overall Iâ€™m pretty happy with it, one of these days I will have to have to install Proxmox on to do some further testing on how well it manages under pressure.</p>
