<p>Git git gitâ€¦ one of the most amazing tools created to help make collaborated development easier, but can be quite tricky to get used to.
The inspiration came to me to write this post to help those people who want to get started with it, but still find it a little freighting.</p>

<p>Git is a DevOps tool used for source control. It is a completely free and open-source version control system used to efficiently handle small to very large projects. Git is used to track changes to source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on nonlinear development. In fact, Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.</p>
