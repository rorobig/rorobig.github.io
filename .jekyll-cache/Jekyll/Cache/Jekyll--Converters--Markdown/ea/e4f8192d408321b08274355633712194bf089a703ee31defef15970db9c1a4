<h4 id="the-windows-11-experience">The windows 11 experience.</h4>
<p>Iâ€™ve been using windows 11 for 3 weeks now and iâ€™ve gotta say, the windows experienced has been significantly improved.<br />
What i like the most about it is the smootness. The experience feels very polished and something i really appreciate is the new notification sound. In Windows 10 i found them quiete sharp. In windows 11 they have been dimmed down to be less intense on the ears.</p>

<h4 id="wsl">WSL</h4>
<p>The holy saviour himself, Windows Subsystem for Linux. Back in the days I used to have a dual boot setup so i can do my school work or develop on. However developing on windows and figuring out environment variables is just not it. Luckily windows introduced the wsl which acts like a linux virtual machine that sits directly on the linux kernel. This remove the need to use virtual machines.</p>

<p>In Windows 10 the installation of WSL was a bit of a hassle. In windows 11 that processed has been simplified. Now with just a simple:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wsl --install</code> <br />
in powershell and your done.</p>

<h4 id="final-verdict">Final verdict</h4>
<p>All by all Windows 11 has a very refreshing look to it,windows apps can now be managed via a the cli windows package manager win-get, the wallpapers are very immersive and the quality of the operating system just feels solid. The updates are more controlled now, meaning less update pop ups. Canâ€™t believe iâ€™m about to type these words, but i think windows has finally done it.</p>
